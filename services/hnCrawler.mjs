                  <span class="commtext c00">Maybe since I consider myself more of a software engineer than a developer, I have a different viewpoint, but to me, as a SE, my job is not just to deliver the end product, but actually to produce the version of the end product that is also of as good quality as it can be within the budget and constraints of the business, as well as guarantee enough architectural runway to meet the business future goals and needs without increasing the future cost or lowering the delivery velocity over time. Often, I even contribute to what the end product should be, by consulting and informing on what can or cannot be achieved with technologies, or how by changing certain aspect of the product we can enable a lot more functionality in other ways.<p>That means, throwing a scaffolded template and a prefab framework might be good for an initial proof of concept and v0 testing the market launch, but with Clojure you can often deliver POCs and v0s just as fast, but then have the flexibility to grow it as it needs too, where frameworks often become big drag on what you can do and how quickly you can do so as you need to grow the product.</p><p>Basically, the inner working matters to the end product, especially when products don't have an end, but are really a lifetime of support and continued changes in feature-set and compatibility/scale.

                  <span class="commtext c00">&gt; It's awesome, but can we please just get together at the next Conj conference decide what our "Rails" is going to be? That way we can get down to business<p>I like the rallying call here. I do think it be nice for the community to do whatever to help Clojure's viability and popularity.</p><p>That said, my issue is that I disagree with the approach. I've already moved on to business and I use Clojure.</p><p>I think this is the clash the community faces. On one side you've got the people who seem discontent with the libraries approach, and refuse to embrace the hosted nature, they want a native Clojure, no reliance on interop. They might not know Java or JavaScript and might be unfamiliar with their runtimes, or simply discontent with them and don't want to touch them ever.</p><p>Then you've got the other side of the community, I think where I fall in, I want to do things my way, don't want to learn any framework, instead I'll just do it like I feel and it'll work better for me, as I'll know it ins/out. I dislike framework, I'd rather just straight up use things directly, I want as little indirection, and I have no issue using interop and having a few wrapper shims when needed.</p><p>That side of the community is just delivering business as usual with what's already there, and it doesn't seem much more is needed.</p><p>Unfortunately, I also think there's another dimension between this dichotomy, the latter group, where I fall for example, I think is leaning more experienced, senior, team lead, Clojure is their third to fourth professional language, they've settled in it. The Stackoverflow survey did show Clojure had the most senior leaning user base, and probably because of that is also highest paid.</p><p>I think this is an issue, because take me, in Java, C# or some other language I've worked in professionally, I'm all up on advocating for use of the frameworks, the DI, the design patterns, and I'll contribute. These languages are too heavy, you can never get anything done quickly or without the man-power, and you don't want too, it's not fun. So you need to rally yourself behind one thing, even if it's not perfect, there's no room for experiments.</p><p>The reason I'm using Clojure is to get away from that though, it's for the freedom to experiment, the ability to within the business budget, be able to deliver the same amount yet custom built half of it exactly as I want.</p><p>I couldn't get away with that in Java, I'd miss deadlines.</p><p>So if I assume half the community is like me, I think that's a lot of people who don't want to focus on one framework, or one way to do things.

If this sounds stupid, I would offer Hacker News as a working example of this model.</p><p>My other motivation was that the majority of platforms operate on a popular vote strategy, as a result, content that appeals to our lesser nature tends to do very well. YouTube, for example, could not support the development of content as ambitious as Avatar.</p><p>Content on Zohing is ranked using a "recursive voting" strategy. It attempts to find accounts that have been deemed by other users to be "high quality" and weight their interactions more.</p><p>Put simply: On the spectrum of Avatar to TLC I want creators to aim for Avatar. I am try to create a platform whose underlying game incentivizes the creation of difficult, high effort content instead of reality TV and cable news.</p><p>Zohing was created to function as a mobile web app. Getting it to work smoothly on iOS safari was a real challenge. I had to do some ugly hacks to get 2 way infinite scrolling to work. For version 2 I am going to go with a more conservative approach.</p><p>If you want to know how the recursive vote algorithm works or have any other questions you can email me at: surgeon@zohing.com

I know a MongoDB sme who bills $300/hr to fix common scalability challenges and address technical debt.

                  <span class="commtext c00">This is otherwise known as a "lifestyle business". It's the north star for most people and should be but it's not easy.<p>If you build a $500K a year SaaS business and have very little overhead, you can probably take $200K of that revenue as income and have a good work-life balance that's very comfortable. I know, I was able to do this without taking VC and bootstrapping 100% on credit cards and my own cash.  However, there's an inflection point that happens with this sort of business IF you're not careful -- or it becomes more successful / or becomes a death spiral.</p><p>If we're speaking of a true SaaS model. It can work. But there's "gotchas".</p><p>I did well with this and but eventually sold the business for about 3X and went back to work for another company. But for about 7 solid years as we gained customers and got to that $500-700K, it became very hard to keep it a "balance" as with every 10 customers we added, the more of my time was spent at work and not as much at home.  As we added customers, my "balance" was diminished, so I had to hire people, which then cut my income considerably.  In the end, I realized it was better to sell the business and take the profit I could to pay off my cards and get something out of it before it killed me.  I used to tell people who used to say, "wow, must be great having a business like that!" I used to tell them, "Yes, it's amazing 100 hour work week!".</p><p>It became more of a "job" and less of a "lifestyle" as the customer count increased.  This could have been anecdotal to my business and product, but I have to believe that it won't matter as that size annual revenue demands a bit more of a sophisticated product type. Unless you've hit lightning in a bottle and have a very "light work" product that you're selling and have cracked the code of hitting $500K and having to do barely anything, more power to you... But I don't think there's a lot of those out there and a lot to be created.</p><p>I just find that with most SaaS businesses I've been involved with and built, the product is solving business problems that aren't usually a "set it and forget it" kind of product to meet those requirements and just sit back and collect money...  I find that most SaaS businesses in that range of revenue are complicated and warrant a higher degree of overhead.</p><p>The real challenge is, "little overhead" to be able to create an income and survive.  Support, service and development is expensive and requires more than one person. Good support is important to retain your customers to keep that $500K coming in, and that really is the problem because having just 10-20 customers paying you $500K is far riskier than having 1000 customers paying you $500K.</p><p>Churn is dangerous in SaaS products that are high cost with smaller customer bases.  One or two customers leaving could give you a pretty good dent in your revenue, thus causing you to cut income.  So the trick is mitigating churn by having a product that's priced at a point that you can gain a larger customer base so that churn isn't going to radically impact your revenue.</p><p>But both strategies are going to require support and service and that costs quite a bit of money and can gravely cut your income that has to be passed to engineers/developers who can improve and maintain the product.  I had to hire really good support people and some engineers because as we grew that revenue, the product became more complicated and support and service was more demanding (I had about 400 customers).  I eventually had to cut my income to pass that to people who could take on more because I couldn't do everything.</p><p>So there is a law of diminishing returns with this sort of business strategy.</p><p>It can work, but you have to really strategize, have a product strategy that can generate a good sized customer base but requires very little maintenance, development, support and service.</p><p>But I call this the "holy grail" SaaS business -- they simply don't exist -- or if they do, they are rare birds.
Just be prepared to understand the issues if you do have some success and are lucky enough to grown a SaaS business to $500K+</p><p>Just don't be surprised when you feel like you've succeeded but feel like you're failing.

In such places, the coffee was almost an afterthought, secondary to the social life that went on there.<p><i>The heyday of the coffee house was the turn of the nineteenth century when writers like Peter Altenberg, Alfred Polgar, Egon Friedell, Karl Kraus, Hermann Broch and Friedrich Torberg made them their preferred place of work and pleasure. Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians of the period such as Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Alfred Adler.[15] Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky and Josip Broz Tito were all living in Vienna in 1913, and they were constant coffee house patrons.</i></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_coffee_house" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_coffee_house</a></p><p><i>Ottoman era coffeehouses democratized education across all stratums of society.

Note they don't even have to necessarily ever "pull the trigger" to force Microsoft to make sure they don't lock them out, simply having the credible option to do so is sufficient to achieve their business goals.<p>And having picked up a Steam Deck about a year ago now, going into it with the expectation that it would run maybe half my games and tending away from the AAA releases, I can say they have a <i>very</i> credible option. Valve can run almost everything without Microsoft now. Pretty much everything I have runs on my Deck just fine, since I don't do the multiplayer games that have aggressive anticheat on them. I almost don't even think about compatibility any more because it's just there, for what I do. This has spilled over to my Linux desktop, too; I switched it due to having my fill of Microsoft's belief they own my system, own my users, and can do whatever they like with them, and if that cut off all gaming it would have been fine with me, but in reality the spillover of Valve's efforts is that it works just fine.</p><p>Apple has chosen to make themselves strategically unimportant to Valve by making it probably even more difficult to support them well than to just give up and submit to Microsoft entirely. They could have played this role but have chosen not to, because in their world, this is relatively minor compared to what they want out of their platform.</p><p>So even if the user count is roughly the same, Valve is going to support Linux much more, and is pushing it harder.

Another name for such style of programming is _callback hell_ :) . And when something does go wrong, it is a lot harder to debug.

                  <span class="commtext c00">As the saying goes, a bad workman always blames his tools. You can make a mess in any language, and Clojure is no exception.<p>There are plenty of ways to mitigate the problems the author describes. A few of these things would be having coding standards to ensure that code is written in a way everyone is comfortable with. This also covers things like adding schemas and documentation for maintainability.  Doing pairing and code reviews so that multiple developers are familiar with different parts of the codebase. Having good tests so that you can have confidence that the code does what's intended when you make changes.</p><p>I'm also not sure what makes Clojure esoteric. It's a clean and well designed language that embodies good principles. It's a niche language, but far from being esoteric. I've been using Clojure for over a decade now, and I've seen the opposite of developer churn. Most people are pretty happy to stay at a company using Clojure. The fact that there is high churn is suggestive of a toxic environment that drives people away.</p><p>Finally, here's [1] a talk from a founder of a Clojure startup that grew into a large successful company. Clojure didn't get in the way of that.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-4FiFpkPlQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-4FiFpkPlQ</a>

                  </span></div><br><div class="comment">
                  <span class="commtext c00">The article has some helpful points. But as a programmer-SAAS-founder-who-took-over-ads operation, I have some tips on some insights we gleaned doing paid ads (and getting it to be profitable for us):<p>1. Most important tip: is your product ready for ads?</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Do not do paid ads too early.

  - Do it once you know that your product is compelling to your target audience.

  - Ads are likely an expensive way of putting your product in front of an audience.

    - No matter how good the ad operation, unless your product can convince a user to stay and explore it further, you've just gifted money to Google/X/Meta whoever.

  - If you haven't already, sometimes when you think you want ads, what you more likely and more urgently need is better SEO optimization
</code></pre>
2. The quality of your ad is important, but your on-boarding flows are way more important still.<p></p><pre><code>  - Most of the time, when we debugged why an ad wasn't showing conversions, rather than anything inherent to the ad, we found that it was the flows the user encountered _AFTER_ landing on the platform that made the performance suffer.

  - In some cases, it's quite trivial: eg. one of our ads were performing poorly because the conversion criterion was a user login. And the login button ended up _slightly_ below the first 'fold' or view that a user saw. That tiny scroll we took for granted killed performance.
</code></pre>
3. As a founder, learn the basics<p></p><pre><code>  - This is not rocket science, no matter how complex an agency/ad expert may make it look.

  - There are some basic jargon that will be thrown around ('Target CPA', 'CPC', 'CTR', 'Impression share'); don't be intimidated

   - Take the time to dig into the details

   - They are not complicated and are worth your time especially as an early stage startup

  - Don't assume that your 'Ad expert' or 'Ad agency' has 'got this'.

    - At least early on, monitor the vital stats closely on weekly reviews

  - Ad agencies especially struggle with understanding nuances of your business. So make sure to help them in early days.
</code></pre>
4. Targeting Awareness/Consideration/Conversion<p></p><pre><code>  - Here I have to politely disagree with the article

  - Focus on conversion keywords exclusively to begin with!

  - These will give you low volume traffic, but the quality will likely be much higher

  - Conversion keywords are also a great way to lock down the basics of your ad operation before blowing money on broad match 'awareness' keywords

  - Most importantly, unless your competition is play dirty and advertising on your branded keywords, don't do it.

    - Do NOT advertise on your own branded keywords, at least to begin with.

    - Most of the audience that used your brand keywords to get to your site are essentially just repeat users using your ad as the quickest navigation link. Yikes!
</code></pre>
5. Plug the leaks, set tight spend limits<p></p><pre><code>  - You'll find that while your running ads, you are in a somewhat adversarial dance with the ads platform

  - Some caveats (also mentioned in the article)

    - Ad reps (mostly) give poor advice, sometimes on borderline bad faith. We quickly learnt to disregard most of what they say. (But be polite, they're trying to make a living and they don't work for you.)

    - (Also mentioned in the article) Do not accept any 'auto optimization' options from the ads platform. They mostly don't work.

  - Set tight limits on spends for EVERYTHING in the beginning. I cannot emphasize this enough. Start small and slowly and incrementally crank up numbers, whether it be spend limits per ad group, target CPA values, CPC values - whatever. Patience is a big virtue here

    - If you're running display ads, there are many more leaks to be plugged: disallow apps if you can (article mentions why), and disallow scammy sites that place ads strategically to get stray clicks.

    - For display ads, controlling 'placement' also helps a lot
</code></pre>
6. Read up \`r/PPC\` on Reddit<p></p><pre><code>  - Especially the old, well rated posts here. 

  - They're a gold mine of war stories from other people who got burnt doing PPC, whose mistakes you can avoid.</code></pre></span>

The person who sells bread, the person I see on walk after walk, the person I'm meeting for the first or 4th time... I'm just open-minded and open-hearted, genuinely curious, generous with my time and attention... and it's awesome. With just a few interactions, I feel like I am with my people, that I am valued, that I am around people I appreciate.</p><p>Occasionally I'm met with suspicion (some people don't believe that I am seriously that curious/excited about XYZ that we are doing together), but overall most people seem to appreciate the ready camaraderie. Occasionally I get burned by forming too deep of a connection too quickly with someone who turns out to be untrustworthy, but time has proven that that is a worthwhile risk to take on.</p><p>I think of community as a pyramid – there are infrequent acquaintances at the base, and best friends and family at the top. All of it matters. My strategy is basically to respect the entire pyramid, showing up as fully as possible for everyone.</p><p>Forming friendships rapidly is not easy – it has taken me many years to learn to soften myself and open the mind, but I do keep getting better at it, for everyone's benefit. It greatly helps to share projects (in my case, mostly rock climbing).</p><p>Note that walking (to the grocery store, when bored, when the sun is setting) is a phenomenal way to feel connected with nearby people.

                  <span class="commtext c00">I have heard this argument a lot. Let me tell you it is categorically false. I run multiple bootstrapped software businesses which culminated in a $4 million profit last tax year. After many many years of failure.<p>The biggest mindshift required here is you need to really think what can technology solve. Most products being developed by bootstrappers are competing in a space where the problem is already solved. For example the nth job board. Yes in that case if yours look shitty people won't use it. But that is not a problem at all if you are solving a real problem.</p><p>I will give you one example, and this is me sharing one of my products for the first time: a custom mobile app for housekeepers in rich families in the UK. The mvp for this was built over a weekend using just basic ios tools. Important thing to understand in this market (custom apps for companies) is that you have to go after companies for whom the branding difference is whether they are number 1..3 or 4.. and 4.. companies die due to competition. So if you can in anyway help them stand out for a large annual contract, they will lap it up.</p><p>There are many opportunites like this. Instead if you are building the next app that you are seeing online, ya you are too late.</p><p>The other thing is alpha products that are rough around the edges still exist. Forget the Twitter screenshots. When you used Twitter for the first time, did it look like that screenshot? No it didn't. Because by the time it became popular enough, it had been polished a bit.</p><p>So what you are doing is comparing a product which is popular now vs a screenshot of the thing before it was popular. If you actually look at the first alpha version of things of popular apps now before they were popular, you will see that they are still rough around the edges. 
Maybe a little bit less so as a lot of ui frameworks are available now.</p><p>Also older stuff look rough around the edges even more because ui trends themselves have changed.</p><p>So don't fall for this myth.</p><p>Solve something hard using technology with a ready to go ui kit and get the v1 out there as soon as possible.

That's enough for 0.5-1 million people, while small enough that a regular person can cycle end-to-end.</p><p>* High-speed train access to nearby cities.</p><p>Since, this is a new city people who looove cars don't have to move there. So nothing for them to complain about.

                  <span class="commtext c00">I am in Indian immigrant living in the UK for past 5 years. The housing system here feels extremely stupid to me. They basically resell houses 100+ years old at 5% higher value every year. It's kinda like gold or bitcoin, except those assets are actually very limited in number. But housing is simply artificially limited due to policies.<p>Total UK housing stock is worth 10T GBP vs 2.2T GBP GDP output. Don't think any other country comes even close in terms of skewed reliance on housing as a driver of wealth. I can't imagine the reduction in net worth of citizens (65% are owners) when house prices crash 20% due to higher interest rates. That would be 2T of the 10T value - almost the same as GDP.</p><p>Anecdotally, every British person I know has a common long term goal - save enough money for a 5-10% deposit on a mortgage. The incentives here are all wrong. You build wealth by investing in a house &amp; taking 90% loan to value mortgages instead of actually working harder. Work is just a means to save enough for deposit &amp; afford a mortgage premiums and maybe 1-2 holidays a year.</p><p>People complain UK is stagnating. Companies don't want to IPO in London. I can tell why - banks don't want to lend to SMEs. 50% of their lending is actually housing mortgages. Same with people - they would overwhelmingly invest in a house rather than own company shares. Housing is the root cause of malaise in the economy. Take away the incentives to own a house by building more homes, increasing mortgage rates and eliminating government policies helping people to buy &amp; this country would just become much better

You don't have to actually implement anything, only advise.</p><p>It's like the modern COBOL. Every sizable business runs on SAP, and it's complicated. The demand for high-end consultants in this space has been there for 20 years and won't go away.</p><p>As old man I will express caution that money isn't everything.

On any given day I hear a large number of complaints from the technologists that complex python systems are difficult to look after and we should use something else instead. There's some Rust being used, but there's little chance to get a quant to use Rust to do research because research is an exploratory process and the last thing one wants is a language that requires a lot of thought about lifetimes etc.<p>How is the python-ocaml interop story? To be clear, any language that does not have first-class interop with python is basically dead in the water (at least for our case).
